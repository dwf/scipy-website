Scientific Computing Tools For Python
=====================================

SciPy (pronounced "Sigh Pie") is, broadly speaking, an ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. 

SciPy refers to three related but distinct things:

* A *software library*, a collection of scientific toolboxes based on `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>_`; 
* A *community* surrounding an open source software tool stack, including but not limited to NumPy and SciPy;
* An annual *conference* dedicated to scientific computing with Python.

The SciPy library
-----------------

The SciPy library depends on `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>_`, which provides convenient and fast N-dimensional array manipulation. The SciPy library is built to work with NumPy arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for numerical integration and optimization. Together, they run on all popular operating systems, are quick to install, and are free of charge. NumPy and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful enough to be depended upon by some of the world's leading scientists and engineers, including the Space Telescope Science Institute.

The Tool Stack for Scientific Computing With Python
---------------------------------------------------

Unlike other environments, the SciPy toolstack encompasses many individual packages. 

* Python, the core language 
* NumPy, A library providing a powerful N-dimensional array object for numerical computation
* SciPy, A collection of numerical algorithms and domain-specific toolboxes
* Matplotlib, a very mature and popular plotting package, that provides publication-quality 2D plotting as well as rudimentary 3D plotting
* IPython - A heavily enhanced interactive shell for interactive scientific and parallel computing
* Traits - A package that provides enhanced object support with validation, delegation, 
* Chaco - A Traits-based 2D visualization package for producing highly flexible interactive plotting applications
* TVTK - A Traits-enabled layer that provides Pythonic 
* MayaVi2 - A Traits-based 3D visualization package employing TVTK
* Cython - A Python-like language for writing Python extension modules with the power of C.
